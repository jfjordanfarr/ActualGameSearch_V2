# AI Slop Cleanup Audit - September 8, 2025

**Purpose:** Identify files created during AI exploration that are no longer needed or caused confusion  
**Context:** After resolving the data model gap and scaling issues, clean up abandoned experiments  
**Action Required:** Manual deletion of listed files to prevent GitHub Copilot backup conflicts  

## Files Recommended for Deletion

### 1. Abandoned/Broken Notebooks
**These files contain broken or superseded code:**

```
pipeline/notebooks/data_model_gap_analysis.ipynb          # Malformed notebook created during debug
pipeline/notebooks/debug_phase2.py                       # Python file in notebooks folder (wrong location)
pipeline/notebooks/final_validation.py                   # Python file in notebooks folder (wrong location)  
pipeline/notebooks/migrate_phase1_to_phase2.py          # Python file in notebooks folder (wrong location)
pipeline/notebooks/phase1_complete_implementation.py     # Python file in notebooks folder (wrong location)
pipeline/notebooks/phase2_hybrid_search.py              # Python file in notebooks folder (wrong location)
pipeline/notebooks/test_lexical.py                      # Python file in notebooks folder (wrong location)
pipeline/notebooks/test_ollama_embeddings.py            # Python file in notebooks folder (wrong location)
pipeline/notebooks/test_realistic_queries.py            # Python file in notebooks folder (wrong location)
```

**Reason:** These .py files were incorrectly placed in the notebooks/ directory and contain experimental/debugging code that's been superseded by proper implementations.

### 2. Superseded Scaling Script
```
pipeline/scripts/scale_dataset.py                       # Original broken scaling script
```
**Reason:** This script had the `price_final` KeyError issue that took hours to debug. The working logic is now in `04_fix_data_model_and_scaling.ipynb`.

### 3. Experimental Notebooks (Keep or Archive Decision)
**These may contain useful exploration but could be archived:**

```
pipeline/notebooks/04_phase1_embeddings_ollama.ipynb    # Phase 1 embedding experiments
pipeline/notebooks/05_phase2_hybrid_search.ipynb       # May be superseded by working implementation
AI-Agent-Workspace/Notebooks/test_data_management_strategy.ipynb  # Early data exploration
```

**Recommendation:** Review these manually - they may contain useful research but could be moved to an `archive/` folder.

## Files to KEEP (Important Working Code)

### Essential Working Files
```
✅ pipeline/notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb         # Core data analysis
✅ pipeline/notebooks/02_ranking_evaluation.ipynb      # Ranking algorithm work  
✅ pipeline/notebooks/03_acquire_explore_etl_search.ipynb  # Comprehensive ETL exploration
✅ pipeline/notebooks/04_fix_data_model_and_scaling.ipynb  # FINAL WORKING VERSION
✅ pipeline/src/ags_pipeline/models/steam_models.py    # Canonical data models
✅ pipeline/src/ags_pipeline/scripts/run_etl.py        # Working ETL pipeline
✅ platform/workers/search-api/                        # Complete TypeScript API
```

### Essential Documentation
```
✅ AI-Agent-Workspace/Docs/FINAL_DATA_MODELS_V1.md     # This session's output
✅ docs/data-schema.md                                  # Intended schema reference
✅ infra/d1_schema.sql                                  # Cloudflare D1 schema
✅ AI-Agent-Workspace/Docs/Background/Gemini-Deep-Research-Reports/11_Gemini_DeepThink_Unification.md  # North star
```

## Historical Context of Deleted Files

### pipeline/notebooks/*.py Files
These Python files were created when there was confusion about whether to use notebooks or scripts. The final decision was:
- **Notebooks:** For exploration, debugging, and documentation (`*.ipynb`)
- **Scripts:** For production automation in `pipeline/scripts/` (`*.py`)
- **Modules:** For reusable code in `pipeline/src/ags_pipeline/` (`*.py`)

### scale_dataset.py Issue
This file was created to scale from 20→75 games but failed due to:
1. Expecting `price_final` column (doesn't exist)
2. Not handling Python-style strings in `genres`/`categories`
3. Column name mismatches (`appid` vs `steam_appid`)

The working solution is now in notebook cell 16 of `04_fix_data_model_and_scaling.ipynb`.

### data_model_gap_analysis.ipynb
This was a malformed notebook created during the 64-minute hang debugging session. The analysis was moved to the working notebook.

## Cache/Temp Files (Safe to Delete)
```
pipeline/__pycache__/                                   # Python cache
pipeline/.pytest_cache/                                # Pytest cache
pipeline/notebooks/__pycache__/                        # Python cache
pipeline/scripts/__pycache__/                          # Python cache
pipeline/src/ags_pipeline/__pycache__/                 # Python cache (all subdirs)
.pytest_cache/                                         # Root pytest cache
```

## Summary for Manual Deletion

**High Priority (Confusing/Broken):**
1. `pipeline/notebooks/*.py` files (9 files) - Wrong location, experimental
2. `pipeline/notebooks/data_model_gap_analysis.ipynb` - Malformed
3. `pipeline/scripts/scale_dataset.py` - Broken, superseded

**Medium Priority (Consider Archiving):**
1. `pipeline/notebooks/04_phase1_embeddings_ollama.ipynb` - May have useful research
2. `pipeline/notebooks/05_phase2_hybrid_search.ipynb` - May be superseded
3. `AI-Agent-Workspace/Notebooks/test_data_management_strategy.ipynb` - Early exploration

**Cache Cleanup:**
- All `__pycache__/` and `.pytest_cache/` directories

---

**Total files recommended for deletion:** ~15-20 files  
**Estimated cleanup benefit:** Removes confusion sources, clarifies working vs abandoned code  
**Risk level:** Low (no working code in deletion list)
