Welcome to a fresh workspace! Please update your copilot instructions doc to help orient yourself and then begin development on Actual Game Search. Our folder has a V2 because another attempt with dotnet/aspire was attempted in another neighboring local directory. The current development environment is VS Code on my local Win10 machine, with 128GB RAM and an RTX 3090 (we can do quite heavy analysis when needed).

The copilot instructions have been updated to reflect the current workspace, clarify the V2 context, and provide clear orientation for AI-driven development in this environment. You are now ready to begin development on ActualGameSearch V2, following the unified architectural vision and best practices outlined in the research documentation.

Next steps: If you want to start with project scaffolding, data pipeline setup, or architectural documentation, let me know your priority and I will proceed.

To ground you in the history of what we've researched and tried so far, I'm going to provide you with a few deep research reports, and a requirements doc generated in light of our new north star.

Please update your copilot instructions one more time and then begin scaffolding the project.

Eh. Okay, those edits weren't particularly impressive. You don't need to scaffold a new VS Code workspace. You need to create folders in the VS Code workspace you currently find yourself in.
